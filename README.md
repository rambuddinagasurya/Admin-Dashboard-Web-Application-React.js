# Admin-Dashboard-Web-Application-React.js

This project is a responsive admin dashboard built using React.js. It demonstrates how to create a modern frontend application with multi-page navigation, API integration, search, filtering, pagination, and a dark/light theme.
The dashboard uses a sidebar layout with pages such as Home, Users, and Products powered by React Router. The Users page fetches real data from an API and displays it in a table with search and pagination to make data management simple and efficient. The interface also includes statistics cards and a theme toggle to improve usability and overall user experience.
This project focuses on clean UI design, reusable components, and a scalable frontend structure, making it suitable for real-world admin panel applications.
